			h4 Toyota&apos;s Service application
			p
				| Two applications were designed. One for smartphones
				| (Android and iOS) focused for Toyota clients, in
				| which they could schedule service appointments and
				| trace its service status; additionally they could
				| watch the status of their credit. And the other app
				| was designed for tablets (iOS), focused for service
				| agents of the different car dealerships, where they
				| could trace the status of service of any of its
				| clients.
			p
				| For each application the design workflow started
				| with the understanding of the problem, then the
				| information architecture analysis was made, and
				| based on this discoveries the different sections
				| were proposed and the UI Kit was developed trying to
				| create a visual image that would be consistent
				| across all devices and platforms. For the UI Kit the
				| principles of Atomic Design and Material Design were
				| followed, considering the particularities of each
				| operating system and device to be used.
			p
				| With the visual design proposal, a prototype was
				| made, and a usability test was held, inviting the
				| service agents to test the service application. Then
				| the results were properly analyzed, and the results
				| were presented to the stakeholders. Finally, with
				| these results, improvements to the app were made as
				| a team.

			h4 Profuturo&apos;s Bolsa de Trabajo
			p
				| An online career center was designed with two
				| endpoints. The first one was the pubic web, where
				| the candidates would go and search for open
				| positions and apply. And the second endpoint being
				| the Backoffice where the recruitment team would
				| create and manage the positions.
			p
				| The design workflow started with the understanding
				| of the problem, users, internal processes and
				| business rules. Discovery and empathy workshops were
				| held to understand the process and create the user
				| journey. Also Design workshops helped to discover
				| ideas, and gain user and stakeholder validation.

			h4 Cemex Ventures
			p
				| A Webapp was redesigned with the purpose of helping
				| people with construction projects. The app would
				| help you calculate how much material would be needed
				| to make a wall, room, or an entire house. Also,
				| would give you advise and tutorials on how to make
				| those projects on your own.
			p
				| For the redesign a UI Kit was created following the
				| Atomic Design principles, only taking the colors and
				| typography previously used. With the UI components
				| created, the pages and sections of the Webapp were
				| created with an emphasis of user journey,
				| interaction and usability.

			h4 Seguros Bancomer
			p
				| Two applications for the bank&rsquo;s clients were
				| designed. The first app was a Webapp and was focused
				| on getting car insurance quotations. The second one
				| was a mobile app focused on getting help in case of
				| a small car incident, and using this app the clients
				| could start a insurance claim in minutes without the
				| need to wait for an agent.
			p
				| For the design workflow the steps were:
				| understanding of the problem, information
				| architecture, and mockups, wireframes and prototypes
				| creation.
