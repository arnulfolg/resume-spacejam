          <h3>As UX/UI Designer</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Toyota&apos;s Service application</h4>
          <p>
            Two applications were designed. One for smartphones
            (Android and iOS) focused for Toyota clients, in
            which they could schedule service appointments and
            trace its service status; additionally they could
            watch the status of their credit. And the other app
            was designed for tablets (iOS), focused for service
            agents of the different car dealerships, where they
            could trace the status of service of any of its
            clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each application the design workflow started
            with the understanding of the problem, then the
            information architecture analysis was made, and
            based on this discoveries the different sections
            were proposed and the UI Kit was developed trying to
            create a visual image that would be consistent
            across all devices and platforms. For the UI Kit the
            principles of Atomic Design and Material Design were
            followed, considering the particularities of each
            operating system and device to be used.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the visual design proposal, a prototype was
            made, and a usability test was held, inviting the
            service agents to test the service application. Then
            the results were properly analyzed, and the results
            were presented to the stakeholders. Finally, with
            these results, improvements to the app were made as
            a team.

        <section>
          <h4>Profuturo&apos;s Bolsa de Trabajo</h4>
          <p>
            An online career center was designed with two
            endpoints. The first one was the pubic web, where
            the candidates would go and search for open
            positions and apply. And the second endpoint being
            the Backoffice where the recruitment team would
            create and manage the positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design workflow started with the understanding
            of the problem, users, internal processes and
            business rules. Discovery and empathy workshops were
            held to understand the process and create the user
            journey. Also Design workshops helped to discover
            ideas, and gain user and stakeholder validation.

        <section>
          <h4>Cemex Ventures</h4>
          <p>
            A Webapp was redesigned with the purpose of helping
            people with construction projects. The app would
            help you calculate how much material would be needed
            to make a wall, room, or an entire house. Also,
            would give you advise and tutorials on how to make
            those projects on your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the redesign a UI Kit was created following the
            Atomic Design principles, only taking the colors and
            typography previously used. With the UI components
            created, the pages and sections of the Webapp were
            created with an emphasis of user journey,
            interaction and usability.

          <h4>Seguros Bancomer</h4>
          <p>
            Two applications for the bank&rsquo;s clients were
            designed. The first app was a Webapp and was focused
            on getting car insurance quotations. The second one
            was a mobile app focused on getting help in case of
            a small car incident, and using this app the clients
            could start a insurance claim in minutes without the
            need to wait for an agent.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the design workflow the steps were:
            understanding of the problem, information
            architecture, and mockups, wireframes and prototypes
            creation.

          <h4>Inflection Point&apos;s Webpage and Blog</h4>
          <p>
            The corporative webpage and blog were redesigned.
            For both projects the design was done, and the front
            end was coded, working close with the designers and
            stakeholders to solve problems.

          <p>
            The intranet for a public pension system in United
            States was redesigned. This Intranet allows
            employees to search coworkers, watch news, events,
            and birthdays. Also allows employees to create work
            groups, share documents and send instant messages.

          <h4>University of Miami Online</h4>
          <p>
            The University of Miami was redesigned. This website
            allows people to see information about Master and
            PhD courses. It was done with a mobile-first
            approach due to a previous discovery that users were
            starting to access the website from mobile devices.

          <h4>Internal Application</h4>
          <p>
            An internal application for the city hall focused on
            measuring its made promises and how much progress
            has been made for each one. The system allows users
            to add the promises and objectives and assign them
            to the responsible people.
